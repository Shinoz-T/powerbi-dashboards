# Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard built using Blinkit Sales Data. The dataset is inspired by Blinkit (formerly Grofers), an online grocery delivery service, and demonstrates the use of Power BI to create interactive data visualizations and business intelligence solutions.

## Dashboard Overview

### Blinkit Sales Dashboard
This dashboard provides insights into the performance of Blinkit sales across different regions, categories, and product types. The data is fabricated for the purpose of showcasing Power BI skills, but the dashboard mimics real-world business scenarios such as:
- Sales performance by region and product category
- Trends in customer purchases over time
- Comparison of product performance across different cities

You can interact with the dashboard by exploring different filters and slicers (e.g., product categories, time periods, regions).

### Features:
- **Sales Insights**: Visualize total sales, sales growth, and top-performing products.
- **Customer Analysis**: Track customer purchase trends, average spend per customer, and demographics.
- **Geographic Analysis**: See how sales perform across different cities and regions.
- **Date/Time Analysis**: Use date-based slicers to explore trends over weeks, months, or quarters.

## Files in this Repository

- **`Dashboard`**: The main Power BI file containing the sales dashboard.
- **`DataSet`**: An Excel file with the data used for the dashboard (contains sales, product, and customer information).
- **`images/`**: Screenshot of the dashboard for demonstration purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**: For creating the interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Excel/CSV**: For creating and managing the dataset used in the dashboard.
- **DAX**: Data analysis expressions used to create custom measures and calculations for the dashboard.

## Future Improvements
- **Additional Dashboards**: I plan to add more dashboards focused on different areas of business, such as customer churn, inventory management, and marketing performance.
- **Deployment**: I plan to explore Power BI Service for sharing and publishing dashboards online.
- **Advanced Features**: I will work on incorporating advanced features like machine learning, real-time data updates, and dynamic dashboards.
